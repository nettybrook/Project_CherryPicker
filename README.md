## CodePath iOS for Designers: Group Poject - Project CherryPicker

### App Description
CherryPicker lets you visually browse a collection of items - and provide input on the items you view. They might be new items to consider purchasing or previously purchased items that you would like to rate. You can use gestures to add them to a cart or to quickly rate them. The more items you rate - the more savings and rewards you build up to purchase new items.
